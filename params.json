{"name":"HIV World Prevalence Overview ","tagline":"In order to raise the public awareness of the HIV/AIDS prevention and find out effective approaches to alleviate its spreading, our team decides to implement an N-tier web application to visualize related data. By mapping groups of data to a graph, our application should be able to tell a story about recent trends of HIV/AIDS and potential correlated factors. By digging into open data, such as The World Bank data and The Open US data, our application is able to promote government transparency and facilitate the policy makers. Our team plans to design and build a N-tier web application to visualize the HIV prevalence and its correlated factors. The application is an interactive design based on javascript libraries. Users are able to interact with a Choropleth Map page, a Line Chart page, a Bubble Chart page and a customized preference page embedded in this system. By interacting with this application, users can investigate the current trends and prevalence of the global HIV infection.
